# Developer Ecosystem & Tooling

LEA is designed to be a developer-first protocol. The success of its modular architecture depends on providing builders with powerful, intuitive, and comprehensive tools to design, deploy, and manage their Programmable Object Domains (PODs). The LEA ecosystem is being built with a suite of open-source tools to streamline this process.

## The Developer Workflow: From Idea to POD

Launching a new execution environment on LEA follows a clear, structured path:

1.  **Design the Application Logic:** Define the core purpose of the POD. This involves designing the smart contracts that will manage the POD's state and business logic (e.g., an AMM contract, an identity registry, a voting mechanism).
2.  **Implement the Decoder:** This is the most critical step. The developer writes a **Decoder** smart contract in a WASM-compatible language (like Rust). This contract defines the POD's unique transaction format, signature verification scheme, fee logic, and replay protection mechanism.
3.  **Compile and Test:** Using the LEA SDK and CLI, the developer compiles their Rust contracts and Decoder to WASM. The local development environment allows for rigorous testing of the entire transaction lifecycle before deployment.
4.  **Deploy to LEA:** The compiled WASM bytecode for the Decoder and its supporting smart contracts are deployed on the LEA chain. Each one receives a permanent, 32-byte address.
5.  **Register the POD (Optional):** To enhance trust and discoverability, the developer can register their Decoder's address in a public, on-chain **Decoder Registry**. This allows wallets and explorers to display human-readable information about the POD and its security properties.
6.  **Build the Front-End:** With the on-chain components live, the developer can build a user-facing application (web or mobile) that constructs transactions for their specific POD and submits them to the LEA network.

## Core Tooling: The LEA SDK & CLI

The LEA core team is committed to providing a robust, developer-first set of tools:

-   **LEA SDK:** A software development kit, initially focused on Rust, designed to make secure development easy.
    -   **Secure-by-Default Libraries:** The SDK provides audited, canonical libraries for critical functions like signature verification and replay protection. A `#[secure_decoder]` macro automatically uses these safe defaults, while still allowing experts to override them when necessary.
    -   **Cryptography & Serialization:** Pre-built functions for common signature schemes (Ed25519, Falcon-512) and tools for safely parsing `Payloads`.
    -   **Structured Event Logging:** A host function, `log_event()`, allows Decoders to emit detailed, structured logs. This enables powerful debugging, allowing developers to trace the exact execution path of a transaction.

-   **LEA CLI:** A command-line interface for the end-to-end development lifecycle.
    -   `lea-cli new --template <name>`: A scaffolding tool that generates boilerplate for common POD types (e.g., a DEX, a DAO), dramatically lowering the barrier to entry.
    -   `lea-cli build`: Compiles Rust smart contracts to optimized WASM.
    -   `lea-cli deploy`: Deploys contract bytecode to the network.
    -   `lea-cli trace`: Runs a transaction locally and renders the structured event logs in a human-readable format, providing a clear audit trail for debugging.

-   **Local Development Network:** A single-node version of the LEA chain that can be run locally for fast, cost-free testing.

## The Tiered Decoder Registry: A Trust Framework

To protect users and manage the risk of malicious Decoders, the LEA ecosystem provides a **Tiered Decoder Registry**. This on-chain registry is a core piece of security infrastructure that allows wallets to inform users about the trust level of the code they are running.

-   **Tier 3 (Untrusted):** Any newly deployed Decoder. Wallets will show a high-friction warning: "[DANGER] This transaction uses an unaudited execution environment."
-   **Tier 2 (Registered):** The developer has registered the Decoder with source code links and has passed automated checks. Wallets show a caution: "[WARNING] This POD is not professionally audited."
-   **Tier 1 (Certified):** The Decoder's source code has been formally audited by a reputable firm, and the on-chain bytecode matches the audited code. Wallets show a confirmation: "[CERTIFIED] This POD has been audited."
-   **Tier 0 (Canonical):** Reserved for core protocol Decoders built and maintained by the LEA Foundation.

This system creates a strong incentive for developers to follow best practices and provides a clear, verifiable signal of trust for users.

## LPM: The LEA Package Manager

To foster a secure and composable developer ecosystem, LEA will introduce the **LEA Package Manager (`lpm`)**, a decentralized solution for smart contract discovery and integration, inspired by tools like NPM and Cargo but redesigned for the high-stakes environment of Web3.

`lpm` will serve as the user-friendly CLI for the on-chain contract registry. It allows developers to easily find, install, and interact with shared on-chain contracts, such as a canonical `sha256` implementation or a standard token interface.

### Security-First Design:
`lpm` is architected to prevent the supply-chain attacks common in Web2 package managers.
-   **Integration with the Tiered Registry:** The `lpm` tool will prominently display the security tier (`[CERTIFIED]`, `[UNTRUSTED]`, etc.) of every package. Installing unaudited code will require explicit user consent.
-   **Content-Addressing:** While packages have user-friendly names, the canonical identifier for every dependency is the immutable hash of its on-chain bytecode.
-   **Mandatory Lockfiles:** `lpm install` will generate a `lpm.lock` file, locking the exact on-chain address and bytecode hash of every dependency. This guarantees reproducible builds and prevents malicious package updates.
-   **Namespace Governance:** Critical package names will be governed by the LEA Foundation or a DAO to prevent typosquatting and hijacking.

By building a package manager on a foundation of on-chain trust, `lpm` will empower developers to build complex applications safely and efficiently, accelerating the growth of the entire LEA ecosystem.
