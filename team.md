## Core Team

### Andre Hassan – Co-Founder, Head of Product & Operations

Andre leads the product strategy, operations, and ecosystem development for LEA. He bridges the gap between the protocol's advanced technical capabilities and its real-world application, overseeing the development of the LEA Pulse mobile application, developer tooling, and partner integrations.

With a Master's degree in Business Informatics and a background as the founder of a successful quality assurance firm for large-scale software systems, Andre brings a focus on operational excellence, user experience, and scalable infrastructure. He is responsible for ensuring the LEA platform is not only powerful but also accessible and reliable for developers and end-users alike.

-   **Specialization:** Business informatics, product management, quality assurance, mobile infrastructure, and ecosystem growth.

### Allwin Ketnawang – Co-Founder, Chief Architect

As the lead architect of the LEA protocol, Allwin is responsible for the design and implementation of the core consensus and execution layers. His work focuses on the practical application of advanced cryptographic systems, including the integration of post-quantum signature schemes and the design of the verifiable state compression model using zk-STARKs.

With over a decade of experience in cybersecurity and systems engineering, Allwin has a proven track record in blockchain security, having conducted numerous penetration tests and smart contract audits for major industry players. His expertise ensures that LEA is built on a foundation of security, efficiency, and long-term resilience.

-   **Specialization:** Layer 1 protocol design, post-quantum cryptography, smart contract security, consensus algorithms.

## Advisors & Community

LEA is a community-driven project and is actively collaborating with a growing network of advisors, ecosystem partners, and independent contributors. Our philosophy is to build in the open, leveraging the collective expertise of the broader blockchain community to refine, test, and secure the protocol.

We welcome contributions in all forms, from submitting LEA Improvement Proposals (LIPs) and developing open-source POD templates to participating in security reviews and building core developer tools. The future of LEA will be shaped by the builders and users who make up its vibrant ecosystem.
