The $LEA token is not being sold to finance the network's development. The LEA Foundation is funded by private equity and the founders. The token distribution is designed exclusively to foster a healthy, secure, and active ecosystem by distributing tokens to those who contribute to and use the network.

# Validator Node Allocation

Participation as a validator requires staking a fixed amount of $LEA. This requirement serves exclusively for network security (Sybil resistance) and is determined by protocol governance. It is not intended to influence the token's price. The number of validator slots is technically limited, and participation is open to all who meet the staking requirements and provide the technical prerequisites.
