# Risk Factors

| #  | Risk Factor | Likelihood | Potential Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|-------------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1  | **Market Risk** – $LEA and POD-native tokens may experience extreme volatility, especially in early stages with low liquidity. | High | Significant loss of token value, difficulty executing large trades without slippage. | Gradual token release schedules, liquidity incentives, and diversified exchange listings. |
| 2  | **Regulatory & Legal Risk** – Jurisdictions may alter laws on digital assets, enforce stricter KYC/AML rules, or restrict blockchain participation. | Medium | Restrictions on token sales, limited market access, operational delays. | Ongoing legal review, compliance-first token sales, flexible architecture to adapt to local regulations. |
| 3  | **Technical Risk** – Smart contract bugs, cryptographic failures, or vulnerabilities in verifiable state compression / cross-POD calls. | Medium | Loss of funds, service disruption, reputational damage. | Independent security audits, bug bounty programs, staged feature rollouts. |
| 4  | **Adoption & Ecosystem Risk** – Failure to attract developers, users, and validators; competition from other L1 protocols. | Medium | Reduced network utility and long-term sustainability. | Developer grants, targeted ecosystem partnerships, aggressive community onboarding via LEA Pulse. |
| 5  | **Operational & Infrastructure Risk** – Network downtime, validator or prover participation drop, reliance on external hosting or app stores. | Low-Medium | Decreased trust, temporary service unavailability. | Decentralized hosting options, validator incentives, redundant infrastructure providers. |
| 6  | **Governance Risk** – Concentration of voting power, contentious decisions, or governance attacks. | Low-Medium | Potential forks, unfavorable protocol changes. | Transparent governance rules, staking-based participation, governance simulations before deployment. |
| 7  | **Security & Key Management Risk** – Private key loss or compromise despite account abstraction safeguards. | Medium | Permanent loss of funds or access. | Social recovery features, multi-sig wallets, user education on security best practices. |
| 8  | **Liquidity & Tokenomics Risk** – Insufficient liquidity, token unlock events causing sell pressure. | Medium | Price instability, reduced investor confidence. | Vesting schedules, liquidity pool incentives, treasury-backed market support. |
| 9  | **Third-Party & Dependency Risk** – Reliance on external oracles, APIs, or unaudited Decoders. | Medium | Service disruption, data manipulation, user loss. | Tiered Decoder Registry, whitelisted oracle providers, mandatory audits for high-impact Decoders. |
| 10 | **Force Majeure Risk** – Global crises, cyber warfare, or large-scale network outages beyond project control. | Low | Severe operational disruption. | Disaster recovery plans, distributed team operations, geographic validator diversity. |
