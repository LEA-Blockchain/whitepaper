# Abstract

The LEA blockchain introduces a paradigm shift in Layer 1 protocol design by radically decoupling execution from consensus. It functions as a minimal, permanent, and secure data ordering service that delegates all transaction validation and state transition logic to a network of user-deployed, on-chain smart contracts known as **Decoders**. This architecture enables **Programmable Object Domains (PODs)**â€”specialized, modular execution environments that can coexist on a single, unified consensus layer.

LEA's core innovation lies in its treatment of state and history. While all contract state is retained on-chain to ensure data availability, the protocol uses **zk-STARKs** to compress the *verification* of dormant contract histories. This allows new nodes to sync and validate the entire state of the network with cryptographic certainty, without re-executing every historical transaction. This "verifiable state compression" model provides extreme scalability and efficiency while avoiding the data availability pitfalls of traditional state-pruning systems.

Transactions on LEA are linked via a per-account **signature chain**, providing inherent replay protection and a verifiable audit trail. This, combined with a native account abstraction model that separates permanent addresses from updatable on-chain keys, allows for post-quantum cryptographic agility and sophisticated key recovery mechanisms to be implemented at the application layer. By minimizing the base protocol's responsibilities to ordering and dispatching, LEA creates a future-proof foundation for permissionless innovation, supporting a diverse ecosystem of interoperable or isolated domains, from regulated finance to anonymous digital economies.
