# Legal Classification & Compliance

The $LEA token is designed and issued solely as a **utility token** for use within the LEA blockchain network. Its primary functions are:

- Securing the network through staking.
- Participating in protocol-level governance via LEA Improvement Proposals (LIPs).
- Paying certain protocol-level fees.

## What $LEA Is Not
- $LEA does **not** grant ownership rights in the LEA Foundation or any affiliated entity.
- $LEA does **not** entitle holders to dividends, interest, or any form of profit-sharing.
- $LEA is **not** backed by any fiat currency, commodity, or real-world asset.
- $LEA is **not** redeemable for fiat or other assets from the LEA Foundation or any other entity.

Any Programmable Object Domain (POD) that issues asset-backed tokens (e.g., Real-World Asset PODs) will do so **independently** and in compliance with applicable regulations. These tokens will be **technically and legally separate** from $LEA.

## Compliance and AML/KYC
- All sales of $LEA to residents of the EU will be subject to **Know Your Customer (KYC)** and **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** procedures.
- Sales will be restricted to jurisdictions that are not subject to international sanctions.

## Secondary Markets
The LEA Foundation will not take any measures to list the $LEA token on digital asset trading venues or to provide liquidity on such platforms. The purpose of the $LEA token is exclusively its use within the LEA protocol. Should the token be traded on secondary markets, this will occur organically and without the involvement or promotion of the foundation. The value of the token should derive from its utility within the network, not from speculative trading activities.

## Regulatory Risk
The regulatory landscape for digital assets is evolving. Future regulations may impact the use, transfer, and exchange of $LEA. The LEA Foundation will monitor regulatory developments and adapt its operations to remain compliant.

## No Investment Advice
This whitepaper does not constitute investment advice, a prospectus, or an offer of securities in any jurisdiction. The purchase of $LEA involves significant risk, and potential purchasers should consult with their own legal, financial, and tax advisors.

Any POD that issues asset-backed or regulated tokens will do so independently, in compliance with applicable regulations, and these tokens will be **technically and legally separate** from $LEA.
